      <description>Version Control Learnt about 3 main types of version control systems: 1. Local: All repositories/data are only held and accessible from a local machine, making it difficult to collaborate with others. 2. Centralised: The repository is kept on a main server, any updates have to be committed to the central server. 3. Distributed: Repositories are distributed across end users and servers. Any of the users or servers can act as the central repository.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve embarked on a 12 week Cloud Engineering Academy, with the aim to increase my knowledge and skills in cloud computing. This is my first blog and I will be using this blog space to post summaries of my weekly study. The blog is currently hosted on Github and I am aiming to move the blog onto my cloud host as I progress through the course.&#xA;Week 1&#xA;To make my weekly summary, I start by making a list of topics/subjects that I study this week from my Obisidian note titles.</description>
