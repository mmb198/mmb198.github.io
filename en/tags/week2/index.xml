      <description>Version Control Learnt about 3 main types of version control systems: 1. Local: All repositories/data are only held and accessible from a local machine, making it difficult to collaborate with others. 2. Centralised: The repository is kept on a main server, any updates have to be committed to the central server. 3. Distributed: Repositories are distributed across end users and servers. Any of the users or servers can act as the central repository.</description>
