      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve embarked on a 12 week Cloud Engineering Academy, with the aim to increase my knowledge and skills in cloud computing. This is my first blog and I will be using this blog space to post summaries of my weekly study. The blog is currently hosted on Github and I am aiming to move the blog onto my cloud host as I progress through the course.&#xA;Week 1&#xA;To make my weekly summary, I start by making a list of topics/subjects that I study this week from my Obisidian note titles.</description>
