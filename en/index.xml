      <description>The Cyber Engineering Academy started as a 12 week course with a new subject per week (12 weeks = 12 subjects) but this was a little ambitious! The reality is that a single week for AWS (week 5), isn&amp;rsquo;t enough time so this timeline has been blown out. I&amp;rsquo;ll now be referring to modules rather than weeks.&#xA;Module 3 - System Design and Architecture This module covered common architecture types (monolithic, microservices and serverless), Application Programmable Interfaces (APIs), Load Balancers and cloud storage options (object, block and file).</description>

      <description>Version Control Learnt about 3 main types of version control systems: 1. Local: All repositories/data are only held and accessible from a local machine, making it difficult to collaborate with others. 2. Centralised: The repository is kept on a main server, any updates have to be committed to the central server. 3. Distributed: Repositories are distributed across end users and servers. Any of the users or servers can act as the central repository.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve embarked on a 12 week Cloud Engineering Academy, with the aim to increase my knowledge and skills in cloud computing. This is my first blog and I will be using this blog space to post summaries of my weekly study. The blog is currently hosted on Github and I am aiming to move the blog onto my cloud host as I progress through the course.&#xA;Week 1&#xA;To make my weekly summary, I start by making a list of topics/subjects that I study this week from my Obisidian note titles.</description>
